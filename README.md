Assignments and Tasks done in course Parallel Computing during Undergrad @ BITS Pilani

-  All programs in this repo are Parallel Programs. 
-  These are implemented using MPI or Pthreads or OpenMP or CUDA. 
-  Each directory has it's own readme inside.
-  There is also a design document along with each of the directory giving explaination of algoithms and other stuff w.r.t implementation of parallel algorithm.
